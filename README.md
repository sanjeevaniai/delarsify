# DeLARSify - AI-Powered LARS Management System

## Project Overview

DeLARSify uses a three-agent AI architecture to address LARS (Low Anterior Resection Syndrome) at multiple stages of care. The system provides continuous knowledge, predictive decision support, and personalized management through three specialized agents.

## Three-Agent Architecture

### 1. LARS AMA Agent
- Synthesizes evidence into patient- and clinician-friendly guidance
- Transforms complex medical research into actionable recommendations
- Provides accessible information for both patients and healthcare professionals

### 2. LARS Likelihood Predictor
- Predicts probabilistic LARS severity pre-surgery
- Uses advanced algorithms to assess risk factors
- Enables proactive treatment planning

### 3. LARS Manager
- Continuously monitors patient progress
- Integrates lifestyle and clinical data
- Personalizes treatment recommendations
- Provides ongoing support and management

## Features

- Evidence synthesis and guidance
- Pre-surgery risk prediction
- Continuous monitoring and management
- Personalized treatment recommendations
- Clinical decision support tools
